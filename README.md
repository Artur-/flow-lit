# Vaadin 14 & Lit

The example consists of a lazy loading list of persons, which are also plotted on a map. Push is used to update person locations in real time.

# Quickstart
Run the project as

mvn

# List & Map view

![map-list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/260340/64474122-ae2d5d00-d178-11e9-87fc-9b20e22f4208.png)

[ListAndMapView.java](https://github.com/Artur-/flow-lit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/vaadin/artur/lit/view/listmap/ListAndMapView.java) is a simple template-based view; it just adds the `LazyList` component to the (unnamed) slot in the template, while letting the template handle everything else. Note the annotations specifying which template to use, as well as enabling server push.

```java
@Tag("listmap-view")
@JsModule("./listmap-view.js")
@Push
public class ListAndMapView extends Component implements HasComponents {
	public ListAndMapView() {
		add(new LazyList());
	}
}
```

The associated template ([listmap-view.js](https://github.com/Artur-/flow-lit/blob/master/frontend/listmap-view.js)), has a few elements around a single slot where the lazy list will end up. The elements are laid out using CSS in the template.

```js
  render() {
    return html`
    <github-corner><a href="https://github.com/Artur-/flow-lit"></a></github-corner>
      <div class="container">
          <slot></slot>
          <marker-map></marker-map>
      </div>
      <lazy-loading-indicator></lazy-loading-indicator>
    </div>
    `;
  }
```

## The List
LazyList shows a more complex use of Lit. The [server-side Java](https://github.com/Artur-/flow-lit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/vaadin/artur/lit/view/listmap/LazyList.java) class provides lazy-loading of the Person list (with a fake delay to make the laziness visible) and pushes movements of the currently visible persons. The Java class provides the data, while the Lit template does handles the rendering.

```java
public LazyList() {
  List<Person> persons = PersonService.get().get(0, 10);
  loadedInBrowser = 10;
  getElement().setPropertyJson("persons", toJson(persons));
  getElement().addEventListener("load-persons", e -> {
    try {
      Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e1) {
    }
    loadedInBrowser += 10;
    sendEvent(PersonService.get().get(loadedInBrowser, 10));
  });
}
```

Meanwhile, the Lit template in [lazy-list.js](https://github.com/Artur-/flow-lit/blob/master/frontend/lazy-list.js) defines the presentation of the data and handles all interactions, requesting more data when needed (using an IntersectionObserver):

```js
render() {
  return html`
    ${repeat(
      this.persons,
      person => person.id,
      (person, index) => html`
        <j-card class=${classMap(person.classes ? person.classes : {})} @click="${e => this.personSelected(person)}">
          <h3 slot="title"><a-avataaar identifier="${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}"></a-avataaar>${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}</h3>
          <div>${person.company}</div>
          <div>${person.address}</div>
          <span>${person.zip} ${person.city}</div>
        </j-card> `
    )}
```

This uses the Lit `repeat` directive to loop over all the available persons and render a `<j-card>` element (from [j-elements](https://github.com/jouni/j-elements)) for each person. The `repeat` directive uses three parts:

1. `this.persons`, which is the list of persons populated by the server
1. `persons => person.id` defines the identity of individual items so they can be updated later
1. ```(person, index) => html`...` ``` defines the markup to render for each person. Here the person and index variables are related to the active person being rendered.

A click listener is added to each card using ```@click="${e â‡’ this.personSelected(person)}``` which calls the `personSelected` method with the selected person as an argument. This is used to highlight the person in the list and also to emit a `person-selected` event when a person is selected so the map can highlight the selected person without going through the server.
